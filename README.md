# Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit
The election commission provided us with a raw data file containing ballot-level detail of votes cast in the recent congressional election.  The commission asked us to provide summary statistics for the raw data at both a candidate and district level, as well as to provide a method for automating the analysis of similarly structured data files that could then be applied to other raw data provided in the future.

## Election Audit Results
